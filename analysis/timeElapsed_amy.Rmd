Questions to Answer:
How long does it take, on average, to obtain the goal amount of funding? 
How much, on average, does the amount of funding differ from goal?

Follow Up Questions:
Time elapsed between launch date and goal reached: 5 number summary and other important features --> look at distribution of days of successful campaigns

Mean/median time elapsed by top categories

Likelihood of success given days passed: Is there a point where ppl should just give up bc itâ€™s been too long?  

1.
Found time elapsed (in days) between the day launched and the deadline, then subsetted data to only include successful (state = successful) campaigns.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ks <- read.csv("ks18.csv")
ks$deadline <- as.Date(ks$deadline)
ks$launched <- as.Date(ks$launched)
ks$timeElapsed <- (ks$deadline - ks$launched)
success <- subset(ks, ks$state == 'successful')

```
Summary of time elapsed of all campaigns:
```{r}
fivenum(ks$timeElapsed)

```
Summary of time elapsed of successful campaigns (and mean):
```{r}
fivenum(success$timeElapsed)
mean(success$timeElapsed)
```

The maximum time elapsed of a successful campaign was 92 days. 

2. Summary of funding difference of all campagins:

```{r}
ks$diff <- as.numeric(ks$usd.pledged) - as.numeric(ks$goal)
diffNAdrop <- ks$diff[complete.cases(ks$diff)]
fivenum(diffNAdrop)
mean(diffNAdrop)
```

Summary of funding difference of successful campaigns:
```{r}
success$diff <- as.numeric(success$usd.pledged) - as.numeric(success$goal)
successdiffNAdrop <- success$diff[complete.cases(success$diff)]
fivenum(successdiffNAdrop)
mean(successdiffNAdrop)
```

Visualizations:
Goal amount over Time Elapsed (Successful Campaigns)
```{r}
plot(success$timeElapsed, success$goal, 'h')

success$time_in_days <- as.numeric(success$timeElapsed)
ggplot(success, aes(time_in_days, goal)) + geom_point()
ggplot(success, aes(time_in_days, goal)) + geom_smooth()

ggplot(success, aes(time_in_days, goal)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()

```

Campaigns that are successful are typically completed within 3 months, despite goal price.

Most likely day to be successful:

```{r}
getmode <- function(v) {
uniqv <- unique(v)
uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}
v<- success$time_in_days
getmode(v)
```

Top category and median time elapsed (success)

```{r}
getmode(ks$category)
x <- success$timeElapsed[which(success$category == "Product Design")]
median(x)

```
Top main category:
```{r}
getmode(ks$main_category)
y <- success$timeElapsed[which(success$main_category == "Film & Video")]
median(y)
```
